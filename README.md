# Gradient Colors

* This React application allows you to enter two different colors in two different boxes, these colors will then be mixed and shown
on the screen in a gradient style.

* The React app contains three functional components, App, Input, and Circle.

* The App function component maintains the state for two colors and a boolean.
   It renders the 'Circle' and 'Input' components.  

* Circle, gives you a visual representation of the colors.

* Input allows users to modify the two colors and to toggle between dark text and white text.
